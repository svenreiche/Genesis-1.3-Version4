# Change Log
### [4.6.10] - 2025/10/29
- Release of Version 4.6.10

### [4.6.9] - 2025/09/04
- Enabling the offset feature of the radiation beam when importing from a dump file with importbeam

### [4.6.9] - 2025/09/03
- Added a new routine for roughness wake calculation
- Added the option to dump the single particle wakes in the wake namelist

### [4.6.9] - 2025/07/17
- Release of version 4.6.9
- Added the new namelist alter_beam for transformation 1D transformation of the electron distribution by applying periodic energy modulation and the effect of chicanes
- Added Example 4 to demonstrate the new namelist and to discuss the difference between beamlet and one-4one simulations.
- 
### [4.6.8] - 2025/06/19
- Fixed bug that transformation of particle distribution are now using the energy deviation E_j/<E> -1 and thus avoiding an offset.
- Fixed issue 225 that for very low current and quiet loading the applied shot noise diverges. This has been limited so that the particles stay in the same or at least adjacent bucket. It doe snot change in the bunching factor since in this case the shotnoise is pure random.

### [4.6.8] - 2025/06/17
- Added support for output of twiss parameters at each integration step
- Added support to select only a specific harmonics for output in the main output file

### [4.6.8] - 2025/05/01
- Release of version 4.6.8

### [4.6.7] - 2025/04/16
- Fixed bug of wakefield calculation, which caused some rounding errors und as a consequence heap memory corruption.
- added support for sequence definition in the lattice file. See lattice file for more information.
- add support for relative paths and sub-directories in profile_file

### [4.6.7] - 2024/11/12
- Release of version 4.6.7

### [4.6.6] - 2024/10/21
- fixed: If beamline elements have not a single explicit argument it causes an error message of unsupported element. This is changed to generating an element with default values.

### [4.6.6] - 2024/09/13
- fixed: Matching an imported distribution caused NaN values and therefore a non-sensical simulation. This has been fixed.
- added some explanation to the manual for importdistribution

### [4.6.6] - 2024/06/05
- fixed: Running non 1-4-1 simulations (aka quiet loading) with zero current (e.g. step profile) causes NaN events in the particle phase for the calculation of the shot noise. It ripples through the simulation producing more NaN in other parameters.
- fixed: Zero current slices caused a division by zero error in the calculation of the space charge field.

### [4.6.6] - 2024/04/18
- fixed: changing elements via the lattice-namelist methods works again after ignoring any sequence.

### [4.6.6] - 2024/01/30
- fixed: the output record in Field/dgrid in the main output is now consistent with the input parameter. The gridspacing is now given with the record field/gridspacing
- added the output of the Genesis verison info in the outp

### [4.6.6] - 2024/01/25
- fixed: corrected the output for 'Global/frequency' in the main output file
- add example for time-depdendent simulations
- fixed: exclude_current_output switch in &setup had no effect
- fixed: a requested bunching factor is now reproduced correctly for large values 

### [4.6.5] - 2023/12/06
- added sequence from external file
- enable short range space charge
- added the ability to reduce the amount of particles when writing to a beam dump
- added the ability to apply beam shifts or matrix transformation to the electron beam by supplying the corresponding vectors and matrices by an HDF5 file 
- added a check that the time namelist is not evoked once a beam or field has been defined. A warning is printed.
- Catch bug with wakefield if the beam is resampled. In this case the wake definition will be discarded
- Added support for placeholder when writing field and particle dumps.

### [4.6.4] - 2023/10/02
- bug fixed which didn't allow to compile Genesis without the FFTW3 library
- bug fixed for default behaviour of the undulator roll-off parameter kx and ky when only the type helical is defined in lattice file
- bug fix for accesing the vector for the z position when parsing the markers in the lattice file.

### [4.6.3] - 2023/09/12
- added output for the minimum and maximum value of the electron beam for each slice and step. This includes the parameters x,y, px, py and energy. The output is suprressed if the parameter exclude_aux_output is set to true
- Examples have been added for a step-by-step guide on setting up input decks.

### [4.6.2] - 2023/02/28
- improved class `Beam` to reduce memory consumption in simulations with harmonic upconversion

### [4.6.2] - 2022/12/30
- added parameter "outputdir" to "&setup": allows to define directory (relative or absolute) where to store the simulation output

### [4.6.2] - 2022/12/06
- add support for self-consistent calculation of the space charge field on the scale longer than the radiation wavelength. The calculation is controlled
with the boolean flag `longrange` in the efield namelist. It adds also the individual output dataset `LSCfield` in the `beam` group of the output file.
A second boolean flag `reducedLF` controls if the Lorentz Factor is reduced by the undulator field with the scaling factor of sqrt(1+aw^2).
At the moment I cannot decide if the correction is needed since the theory predicts it but experiments at SwissFEL with ESASE shows no dependence on aw when scanning the K-value between 0.8 and 3.7
So I leave in the option to use this correction or not.

### [4.6.1] - 2022/12/06
- add "field_manipulator" feature, currently it can be used to scale to power of the light field

### [4.6.1] - 2022/12/05
- Refactor the name "Time.h" and "Time.cpp" to "GenTime.h" and "GenTime.cpp" to prevent the conflict with the std-library Time.h
- Fixed in Diagnostic.cpp the evaluation of a complext value element with fabs. Replaced it with std::abs

### [4.6.1] - 2022/11/23
- Fixed the bug that importing harmonics with the importfield namelist cause always the error that wavelength and reference length weren't matching.  

### [4.6.1] - 2022/02/16
- Moved the calculation for the output file from the Beam and Field class to the class Diagnostic.cpp. This class interacts with the class  in Output.cpp so that the output class does not need to know the name of the field to be written. This informationis provided by the new class in Diagnostic.cpp. That way it gets easier to add additional output, where only on location needs to be changed (namely the derived classes in DiagnostUser.cpp)
- Command line arguments are now overwriting the correpsonding input the main input file. Supported are the output file root name, the lattice file, the beam line and the seed for the shot noise power.
- The compilation is changed to CMAKE, which allows for some configuration before compilation. It automatically searches for the required libraries and no manual configuration of the Makefile is needed any longer. 
- 20220218: New command line parser
- 20220218: Added support for semaphore file. If requested, this file is written at the end of a successful simulation run.
- 20220218: Exit code of GENESIS binary now depends on status (0 for success, 1 in case of error)
- 20220329: Added additional "start" semaphore file that is written after &setup block was processed
